# Hi there, I'm Syed Haseeb ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Android developer with over 3 years of experience, specializing in AI and general tools development. I started as a Java developer and later transitioned to Kotlin, which is now my go-to language for Android app development. In addition to Android development, I also have experience in web development, Flutter, and desktop app development for Windows and Linux.
